# Weather-Monitoring-Station-and-the-Mood-Lamp

1. Take the following required components from the kit.
● 1 x Breadboard
● 1 x RGB LED
● 1 X DHT11 sensor
● 1 x 330-ohm resistor
● 1 x ESP32
● 1 x USB Programming Cable
● 13 x Male to Male Jumper wires
2. Insert the DHT11 sensor, RGB LED, resistor and the ESP32 in the breadboard.
3. Connect the DHT sensor and RGB LED with ESP32 using male to male jumper wire. By doing this step, your hardware connections are ready.
4. In the project template, write appropriate code, so that you can :
a) Fetch temperature and humidity values from the DHT sensor.
b) Convert the temperature values into fahrenheit and kelvin scale.
c) Calculate the Dew point using the temperature and humidity values.
5. After writing the appropriate code, log on to io.adafruit.com to design the cloud server.
6. Create feeds for temperature in celsius scale, fahrenheit scale, kelvin scale, humidity, dew point, red led, green led and blue led, so that you can read and write data to them.
7. Go to your dashboard so that you create gauges for temperature values.
8. Create a gauge for humidity and text display element for dew point temperature as well.
9. Create slider elements so that you control the intensity of red, green and blue color in an RGB led.
